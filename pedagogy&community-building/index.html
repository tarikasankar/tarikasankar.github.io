		<h2>UM Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI)</h2>
		<p>
		The <a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/">Digital Humanities Research Institute</a>, hosted by the CUNY Graduate Center, trains participants in core 		       technical competencies such as working from the command line, collaborating with git, programming with Python, querying structured data, creating maps, 		       and analyzing texts computationally. Participants also become part of a growing network of institute leaders by developing their own DHRI based on the 		      open, core curriculum to be led at their home institutions or organizations.

		As Community Leaders in the 2021-22 cohort, my co-convener, Dieyun Song and inaugurated the <a href="https://dh.miami.edu/events/index.html">University 		of Miami Digital Humanities Research Institute (UM DHRI)</a> in January 2022. We organized three days of virtual workshops and programming on topics 		     such as mapping in GIS, text analysis in R, and project and data management. We planned the program, gathered sponsorships and funding, andcollaborated 		     with facilitators at the UM Libraries and partners at Latin American institutions. Adapting the DHRI curriculum, we co-facilitated the session on DH   		    fundamentals, teaching an introduction to the command line, markdown, and HTML (with a concurrent session in Spanish facilitated by our collaborator 		Dr. Nicolas Vaughan.)
