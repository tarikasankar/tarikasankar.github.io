		<h2>UM Digital Humanities Research Institute (DHRI)</h2>
		<p>
		The <a href="https://www.dhinstitutes.org/">Digital Humanities Research Institute</a>, hosted by the CUNY Graduate Center, trains participants in core 		       technical competencies such as working from the command line, collaborating with git, programming with Python, querying structured data, creating maps, 		       and analyzing texts computationally. Participants also become part of a growing network of institute leaders by developing their own DHRI based on the 		      open, core curriculum to be led at their home institutions or organizations.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		As Community Leaders in the 2021-22 cohort, my co-convener, Dieyun Song (PhD, History) and I inaugurated the <a 	href="https://dh.miami.edu/events/index.html">University of Miami Digital Humanities Research Institute (UM DHRI)</a> in January 2022. We organized three 			days of virtual workshops and programming on topics such as mapping in GIS, text analysis in R, and project and data management. We planned the 		program, gathered sponsorships and funding, and collaborated with facilitators at the UM Libraries and partners at Latin American institutions. 		Adapting the DHRI curriculum, we co-facilitated the session on DH  fundamentals, teaching an introduction to the command line, markdown, and HTML (with 		a concurrent session in Spanish facilitated by our collaborator Dr. Nicolas Vaughan.)

		Ro(u)ted By Our Stories is an inter-generational, community-owned oral history archive dedicated to sharing the stories of the Indo-Caribbean 			diaspora's silenced voices. The archive works to center the stories of women and gender-expansive folks at various intersections of identity. As a 		   collective, we collaboratively vision the design, mission, and listening practices for the digital archive; collect, edit, transcribe and create 			metadata for oral history interviews; maintain our website; and plan programs and outreach events. In our inaugural Storytelling Institute, a six-week 		       virtual program in winter of 2021-22, we trained participants in oral history methods and explored storytelling as a strategy to dismantle 
		anti-Blackness within Indo-Caribbean communities and support racial justice.
