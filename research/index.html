	<p> Role: Graduate Research Assistant, 2017-2020 <br> Project Manager, 2018-2019 </p>

	<p> Funded by a Mellon Foundation grant, the WhatEvery1Says (WE1S) project used computational methods such as topic modeling to examine public discourse about	 	the humanities across millions of newspaper articles. As a research assistant, I developed research questions,
	analyzed and interpreted findings from topic models and other computational methods, and 
	wrote up public-facing summaries of our results and recommendations for advocacy. In particular, I worked collaboratively to develop our “interpretation 	protocol,” which operationalized our reading and analysis of topic models, and analyzed the role of the humanities in <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-2.pdf">academia</a> and <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-3.pdf">ordinary life</a> and the profile of specific humanistic fields such as <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-11.pdf">literature</a>, <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-10.pdf">history</a>, and <a href="https://we1s.ucsb.edu/wp-content/uploads/KF-5-9.pdf">philosophy</a>. In addition to the linked key findings, see our research lab reports. </p>

	<h2>Digital Diasporic Consciousness: Indo-Caribbean Social Networks Online</h2>
	
	<p> This project-in-progress uses social network analysis of Indo-Caribbean organizations’ Instagram accounts to theorize a 
	“digital diasporic consciousness.” Using metrics such as network connections (who follows 
	who), reciprocity (who follows who back), centrality (which are the most “influential” or most followed accounts) and interconnection across geographic space, 		I will examine how members of the diaspora articulate Indo-Caribbean identity through social media and online technologies, 
	negotiating the possibilities and tensions of digital connectivity. The network analysis will be 
	contextualized with qualitative analysis and digital ethnography of my participation in Zoom 
	workshops and Instagram Live broadcasts.This project began in 2020 with support from a Digital Humanities Graduate Student Fellowship from the 
	University of Miami DH advisory committee.</p>
